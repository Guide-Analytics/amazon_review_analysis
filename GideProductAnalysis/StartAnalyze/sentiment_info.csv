1,4.1,Ron Seigel,I doubt anyone could make a crappier fan if they tried. Luckily for us it's really just meant for white noise in our bedroom. The last one we bought (cheap junk from Canadian Tire) lasted 10 years and it was literally only shut off to clean it. No way this one lasts a year. The medium setting didn't work right out of the package but it would have been more hassle to return it than it was worth.,2018-11-25,Yes,5,78,0,-0.28788179999999997

4,4.1,Christopher Darling,"Went together easy enough. Not too sturdy for a pedestal fan. Does the trick buy feels especially cheap.

I worked in the department that sold fans at Sears for 4 years. This one is maybe slightly below in terms of quality of materials our cheapest fan. It's a cheap fan that works fine. I don't expect it to have a long life though.",2018-10-20,Yes,4,63,0,0.214647
