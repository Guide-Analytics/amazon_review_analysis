1,4.0,Ron Seigel,I doubt anyone could make a crappier fan if they tried. Luckily for us it's really just meant for white noise in our bedroom. The last one we bought (cheap junk from Canadian Tire) lasted 10 years and it was literally only shut off to clean it. No way this one lasts a year. The medium setting didn't work right out of the package but it would have been more hassle to return it than it was worth.,2018-11-25,Yes,5,78,0,-0.28788179999999997
