good features.
small point i find ridiculous is that the remote doesn't come with a battery (cr2032). At this price i think a battery should've been included. maybe rowenta ran out of budget or instead of cheaping out even more on materials quality they chose to forgo the battery.

great fan if purchased on sale. Wouldn't buy it at full price. simply because i find the lack of battery stupid but also fan should be more sturdy at full price. nonetheless its a great fan and you should buy it.

I spent the extra money on this fan because of all the great reviews on Amazon and other online reviews.

Design...
First the fan is kinda funky to look at. It has kind of a weird plastic body that is not functionally doing anything other than to look contemporary. I could take it or leave it design wise.

Next the remote...
OMG this thing is huge! and the buttons actually \""click\"" when you press them! Remember the old original 70's TV remotes that actually clicked when you pressed the buttons? Yup! This remotes buttons click. The size is larger than stereo remote and almost as large as my TV remote. There are not many functions on it either. In fact there are only 3 buttons. ON/OFF, Speed selection, \""Turbo Boost\"". The later being only a 4th speed. There is no fancy features like oscillation control, sleep timer, etc.

Functions...
The fan control panel is equally simple. There are no additional functions such as Oscillate, sleep timer, etc. It does have an oscillate feature but it the old style that has a pop up button on back of fan to turn it on and off. I leave my fan pretty much in the same place so this isn't an issue for me but my previous $30 Costco fan had this function on the fan control panel AND on the remote!

Base...
The base is very solid and the fan doesn't move or wobble when it runs at top speed.

Quietness...
This is hailed as being the quietest fan out there. I can tell you that is partially true. It is quiet as fans go but it's definitely not \""Turbo Silent\""! My $30 Costco fan was indeed less noisy than this model but perhaps didn't push as much air. This fan can be set on speed 2 for the same amount of air movement that my cheapo fan would push on high speed.

Summary...
I purchased this fan because it seems all fans I have purchased eventually just stop working, regardless of how clean I keep them. I have taken the time to completely dis-assemble previous fans and clean the motor and lubricate the shaft bearings however it seems that is only a stop gap fix and the fan dies again in a few months. This results in purchasing a new fan. This fan is more than twice the cost of the cheap fans I usually purchase so time will tell if it lasts any longer. This fan is indeed fairly quiet for the amount of air it pushes although not the quietest I've heard. If you are looking for a simple fan with simple controls that costs a lot of money.

Summary...
I purchased this fan because it seems all fans I have purchased eventually just stop working, regardless of how clean I keep them. I have taken the time to completely dis-assemble previous fans and clean the motor and lubricate the shaft bearings however it seems that is only a stop gap fix and the fan dies again in a few months. This results in purchasing a new fan. This fan is more than twice the cost of the cheap fans I usually purchase so time will tell if it lasts any longer. This fan is indeed fairly quiet for the amount of air it pushes although not the quietest I've heard. If you are looking for a simple fan with simple controls that costs a lot of money. This is your unit!'"",0.148351243243},{""'Purchased this fan to replace a 5+ year old Costco cheapie fan. I spent the extra money on this fan because of all the great reviews on Amazon and other online reviews.

Design...
First the fan is kinda funky to look at. It has kind of a weird plastic body that is not functionally doing anything other than to look contemporary. I could take it or leave it design wise.

Next the remote...
OMG this thing is huge! and the buttons actually \""click\"" when you press them! Remember the old original 70's TV remotes that actually clicked when you pressed the buttons? Yup! This remotes buttons click. The size is larger than stereo remote and almost as large as my TV remote. There are not many functions on it either. In fact there are only 3 buttons. ON/OFF, Speed selection, \""Turbo Boost\"". The later being only a 4th speed. There is no fancy features like oscillation control, sleep timer, etc.

Functions...
The fan control panel is equally simple. There are no additional functions such as Oscillate, sleep timer, etc. It does have an oscillate feature but it the old style that has a pop up button on back of fan to turn it on and off. I leave my fan pretty much in the same place so this isn't an issue for me but my previous $30 Costco fan had this function on the fan control panel AND on the remote!

Base...
The base is very solid and the fan doesn't move or wobble when it runs at top speed.

Quietness...
This is hailed as being the quietest fan out there. I can tell you that is partially true. It is quiet as fans go but it's definitely not \""Turbo Silent\""! My $30 Costco fan was indeed less noisy than this model but perhaps didn't push as much air. This fan can be set on speed 2 for the same amount of air movement that my cheapo fan would push on high speed.

I did not purchase my Rowenta stand fan from Amazon.ca because the price at Amazon.ca at that time was $165. and it was on sale at another online venue for almost the same price that Amazon.ca currently now has it listed for ( Under $100. ) .

Over the past 50 years I have purchased several fans and simply put, this is by far the very best fan I have ever purchased to this date. The silent mode is super silent and is the lowest speed but still creates a sufficient air flow. The turbo speed is super fast and is substantially loud but not as loud as other 16 inch fans I have owned and it puts out volumes of air on this setting. The cosmetics and style of this unit are absolutely elegant and beautiful. The fan grills and name plate are chrome highlighted by the baby blue transparent plastic fan blades with black and silver accents being the over all theme of the stand. It oscillates nicely and the oscillation can be turned off or on with a push or a pull of a knob located on the motor housing and the power cord has a nice length. There are no annoying vibrations anywhere on this fan. It has a countdown timer that you can set that will turn the fan off in either 1 or 2 or 4 or 8 hours. There is also an energy saving mode that when enabled gradually reduces the fan speed over the course of time. The remote is a very tiny and almost a duplicate of the button layout on the stand and it functions perfectly and uses a round 2032 battery ( Note: ) The Battery is Not supplied. Best Buy is the Energizer 2032 - 4 Pack for approximately $12.97 at several venues. The round 2032 batteries are required for most garage door opener remotes and most automobile Key Fobs. The buttons on the fan console light up when selected but unfortunately the remote buttons have no backlight. This is a quality plus stand fan that looks super great and is suitable for either the bedroom or the living room or the office. There is also a table model available for about $90. at Amazon.ca

I recently purchased a second Rowenta VU5670US 16 inch pedestal fan from Amazon.ca for $99.96 and the quality is identical to my first purchase.
