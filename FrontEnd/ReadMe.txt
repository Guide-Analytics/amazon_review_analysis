The frontend dashboard was made with React using the below link:

Please install node and npm on your computer. I used Homebrew to do it.

Then install create-react-app and react-router-dom on your compurer. Delete all the files in public and src folder and instead use the ones over here.

Use NPM start to startthe application.
